# Entropic Aura

**Entropic Aura** is a live generated atmosphere application that streams continuous audio to users. It uses ComfyUI as a backend to generate ambient soundscapes from presets or user prompts.

## Features

### Currently Implemented
- **Live Audio Generation**: Generate atmospheric audio using ComfyUI backend
- **Text Prompts**: Create soundscapes from text descriptions
- **Mood Presets**: Quick selection of mood-based atmospheres (Relaxing, Energizing)
- **Continuous Streaming**: Smooth audio playback via AAC streaming at 128 kbps

### Planned Features
- **Multi-Track Mixing**: 4 simultaneous audio tracks mixed together in real-time
- **Preset Management**: Create, save, and manage custom atmosphere presets
- **Favorites System**: Mark and quickly access favorite presets
- **Playlist System**: Create playlists that rotate atmospheres at configurable intervals
- **Smooth Transitions**: Seamless crossfading between different atmospheres

## Architecture

The application consists of:
- **Frontend**: Vue 3 application with PrimeVue UI components
- **Backend**: Node.js server (`backend/server.js`) that interfaces with ComfyUI
- **ComfyUI Integration**: Text-to-audio generation via custom workflow
- **FFmpeg Workers**: Scalable worker pool for audio transcoding (6 instances recommended)

## Requirements

### Frontend app

Front‑end Vue app with a Node.js helper that streams audio generated by a
local [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) instance through
an FFmpeg filter chain.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- npm

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. (Optional) copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust `VUE_APP_BASE_URL` or
   other settings as needed.

## Development

- Front‑end dev server: `npm run dev` (http://localhost:8080)
- Audio backend: `npm run api` (http://localhost:3000)

## COMFY & FFmpeg

The backend calls a ComfyUI server to synthesize audio then pipes it through
`fluent-ffmpeg` with the bundled `ffmpeg-static` binary. Filters apply
compression, a high‑pass, echo and limiter before outputting AAC at 128 kbps.

By default it connects to `127.0.0.1:8188`. Point to another host with the
`COMFY_HOST` environment variable:

```bash
COMFY_HOST=192.168.1.50:8188 npm run api
```

Each worker provides an FFmpeg binary used to transcode and stream audio in
AAC at 128 kbps.

`docker-compose.yml` includes an `ffmpeg-worker` service that supplies FFmpeg
binaries for transcoding. Build and start everything with:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

1. Navigate in your repo folder: cd `entropic_aura`
2. Install project dependencies: `npm install`
3. Create a new .env file: `cp .env.example .env`
4. `VUE_APP_BASE_URL` should contain the URL of your App
 (eg. http://localhost:8080/)
5. `VUE_APP_API_BASE_URL` should contain the URL of JSON-API server (eg. http://localhost:3000/api/v1)
6. Run `npm run dev` to start the application in a local development environment or `npm run build` to build release distributables.
7. In another terminal, launch the audio backend with `npm run api`.

Integration tests for the backend live in `backend/test/`. Run them with:

Visit [http://localhost:8080/soundscape](http://localhost:8080/soundscape) and
click **Generate** to hear the streaming result in the built‑in audio player.

Register a user from `#/register` or login using pre-created users for other features.

## Storage

The project does not persist data on the server. Audio is streamed directly
from ComfyUI to the client and discarded after playback. Client‑side storage
is not implemented beyond what the browser provides.

### Backend

An experimental Node.js helper lives in `backend/` and demonstrates how to
call a local [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) server to
generate audio and stream it through an FFmpeg filter chain. The helper now
outputs AAC at 128 kbps and is served by `backend/server.js` on `/api/stream`.

Visit [http://localhost:8080/soundscape](http://localhost:8080/soundscape) and
click **Generate** to hear the streaming result in the built‑in audio player.
Adjust `backend/audio-workflow.json` to match your ComfyUI workflow.
